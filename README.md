A peer-to-peer deliver system for moving packages on the go. 
DoSmartMove (www.dosmartmove.com)  A peer-to-peer deliver system for moving packages on the go. Ship w/ ppl people headed in that direction anyway!  ## Inspiration
The idea is to help increase efficiency/optimization when it comes to delivering goods/packages across the nation. Many “truckers” often travel with partially loaded trucks resulting in less “revenue” or items that needing to go from place A to place B.

On the other hand, how many times do you want to ship an item and we have to call Fedex, UPS and have them deliver a small or large package for a high price. The idea is to submit online bids for items you want to ship and a driver can pick up that bid

## What it does
Driver gets a profile, identifies how much room they have, where they are going and how much the charge for said space will be.

Shipper gets a profile submits the items they want to ship, where it needs to go and how much they “budget” is.

The bidding begins when matches are made with “addresses”

## How we built it
The idea was to create a basic website, use a pre-built platform like Toshi to get this kicked off. We ran into many issues with this.

## Challenges we ran into
We could not get the site to work with Toshi, the smart contracts were difficult to put together based on complexity of the parameters, etc .

## Accomplishments that we’re proud of
The learning curve in the entire ecosystem extends beyond many apsects. We’re proud to have been apart of the space and the learning that came with it. The people we met, how much more we know and don’t know about the space is critical, yet humbling.

## What we learned
That there is no simplicity when trying to implement an idea on blockchain.

## What’s next for DoSmartMove
Continue learning about how to implement something like this for a super easy UI for the average person to utilize. Taking this and get a functioning dapp going. Further innovation of the idea, more artwork and integration of smart contracts, community outreach and feedback.
